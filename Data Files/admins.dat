;
; Remote Admin File
;
; This file defines which sernums/soul ids you have granted remote admin
; privileges, and their individual passwords.
;
; Any line in this file which starts with a semicolon is just a comment.
; Any other line adds a serial number to your server's remote admin list.
; Do not add any serial numbers unless you are confident you want this
; feature
;
; If you do add any lines to this file, they must look like this:
;
;   <sernum> <space> <password>
;
; That is to say, start the line with the serial number (soul ID) of the player
; you wish to give remote admin privileges.  Then add a space and a password
;
; Serial numbers should be just the number. So "4B125DEF" for an unregistered
; player, or "1234" for Golden Soul 1234.
;
; passwords may be up to 8 characters long.  For best security, assign a
; different password to each admin.  If you use the same password for everyone
; and one of your admins has loose-lips, hackers may be able to pose as any
; of your registered admins.  Passwords should be just alphanumeric and not
; contain spaces or unusual characters.
;
;
; ------------------
; SUPPORTED COMMANDS
;
; Commands are generated by running the game, connecting to the server in question
; and then opening the 'admin' window (the one which lets you send messages to the
; mix admin).  If your message begins with "/cmd" then it will be a remote admin command.
;
; The format of a remote admin command is then this:
;
;    /cmd  <password> <command> <target> <message>
;
; use SPACES, not commas, to separate the fields.
;
;  * password - the remote admins individual password (defined in this file)
;  * command - one of the remote admin commands: (BOOT, BAN, or MSG)
;  * target - the sernum of the target (or 'all' for global messages)
;  * msg - the message to be sent (or the reason you are banning)
;
; For example:
;
;  /cmd foo msg all Hey everyone, I am a remote admin!  Oops, I should keep that secret!
;  /cmd foo msg 1234 Hey, golden soul 1234, this message is just for you!
;  /cmd foo msg 4B124F32 Hey, unregistered player with a long sernum, this is for you!
;
;  /cmd foo boot 1234  Hey, golden soul 1234 this is kicking you off the server!  but not banning you!
;
;  /cmd foo ban 1234 for being a nasty person!
;
; The ban bans both the sernum and their current IP address.  They can only be un-banned by the real
; server admin.
;
; Please note: you do NOT type remote admin commands into the normal game chat window.
; please re-read the above if that missed your attention.
;
;

; HACKER WARNING
;
; So long as this list is empty, your server should be un-hackable.  If you
; add any sernums at all, then it is possible for a hacker to potentially
; pose as that player and have admin powers on your server.  You are probably
; better off keeping your list secret.
;
; Note that commands received from an unregistered remote admin will lead to the sender
; being automatically banned from the server.  So hopefully hackers will lose 
; interest in trying to crack into your server as false remote admins.
;
;
; ---------------------------
; LOG OF REMOTE ADMIN ACTIONS
;
; In this same folder you will see a file "remoteAdminLog.txt" which will 
; record all remote admin activity (this is also logged live to your
; player comments window.)
;
; -------------------------------------------------------
; The Admin List Follows, add to this list as you see fit.

; you would NOT start this line with a semicolon.  this is just an example:
